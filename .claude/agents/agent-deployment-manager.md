```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
```

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment (Staging)
1. Push to `develop` branch
2. CI pipeline runs (lint, test, build)
3. Auto-deploy to staging
4. Smoke tests run
5. Team notified

### Manual Deployment (Production)
1. Create PR from `develop` to `main`
2. Code review + approval
3. Merge to `main`
4. CI pipeline runs
5. **Manual approval required**
6. Deploy to production
7. Health checks run
8. Monitoring alert

### Deployment Command
```bash
# Manual deployment (if needed)
npm run deploy

# Or platform-specific
vercel --prod
railway up
```

## Environment Variables

### Development
Stored in `.env.local` (not committed)

### Staging & Production
Managed in hosting platform dashboard

**Required Variables:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<secret>
API_KEY=<key>
SENTRY_DSN=<dsn>
```

## Database Migrations

### Migration Strategy
**Before Deployment:**
1. Run migrations in staging
2. Test application
3. Run migrations in production
4. Deploy new code

### Commands
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Rollback if needed
npm run migrate:down
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Current Strategy: Rolling Deployment
- New version deployed gradually
- Old version runs until new is ready
- Zero downtime
- Easy rollback

### Alternative: Blue-Green
- Two identical environments
- Switch traffic instantly
- Quick rollback
- Higher cost

## Health Checks

### Endpoint
```typescript
// GET /health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime": 3600
}
```

### Checks Performed
- [ ] Server is running
- [ ] Database is connected
- [ ] External APIs are reachable
- [ ] Disk space available

### Deployment Verification
1. Health check passes
2. Smoke tests pass
3. Error rate < 1%
4. Response time normal

## Rollback Procedure

### Fast Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Option 1: Revert git commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Option 2: Platform rollback
vercel rollback <deployment-url>

# Option 3: Redeploy previous version
git checkout <previous-commit>
npm run deploy
```

### When to Rollback
- Critical bugs in production
- Error rate spikes
- Performance degradation
- Database migration failure

## SSL/TLS Configuration
**Provider:** [Let's Encrypt / Platform-provided]
**Auto-renewal:** ✅ Yes
**HTTPS:** ✅ Forced redirect

## CDN Configuration
**Provider:** [Cloudflare / Platform CDN]
**Caching:** Static assets cached
**Cache Duration:** 1 year for versioned assets

## Monitoring After Deployment

### First 15 Minutes (Critical)
- Watch error rates
- Monitor response times
- Check database performance
- Review logs

### First Hour
- Verify all features working
- Check background jobs
- Monitor user feedback

### First Day
- Review analytics
- Check for new errors
- Performance comparison

## Smoke Tests
```bash
# Run after deployment
npm run smoke-test

# Tests:
# - Homepage loads
# - API responds
# - Authentication works
# - Critical features work
```

## Release Checklist

### Pre-Release
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Staging tested
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] Team notified

### Release
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Smoke tests pass

### Post-Release
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check performance
- [ ] Verify key features
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Notify stakeholders

## Deployment Schedule
**Best Time:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm
**Avoid:** Fridays, weekends, holidays
**Reason:** Team available if issues arise

## Emergency Deployment
If critical hotfix needed:
1. Create hotfix branch
2. Fix issue
3. Fast-track review
4. Deploy immediately
5. Merge back to develop

## Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency:** Daily (staging), Weekly (production)
- **Lead Time:** < 1 hour from merge to deploy
- **Mean Time to Recovery:** < 5 minutes
- **Change Failure Rate:** < 5%

## Known Issues
- [List any known deployment issues]

## Next Steps
**Recommended Next Agent:** @agent-monitoring-specialist
**Reason:** Deployment is automated, setup comprehensive monitoring
```

## Example Usage
```bash
@agent-deployment-manager "Setup automated deployment to Vercel"
@agent-deployment-manager "Create multi-environment deployment strategy"
@agent-deployment-manager "Implement zero-downtime deployment"
```

## Deployment Best Practices
1. **Automate Everything** - No manual steps
2. **Test Before Deploy** - Staging mirrors production
3. **Deploy Often** - Small, frequent releases
4. **Monitor After Deploy** - Watch for issues
5. **Fast Rollback** - Be ready to revert
6. **Blue-Green or Rolling** - Zero downtime
7. **Database Migrations First** - Before code deploy

## Deployment Strategies Compared

### Rolling Deployment
✅ Zero downtime
✅ Gradual rollout
✅ Easy rollback
❌ Temporary version mix

### Blue-Green Deployment
✅ Instant switch
✅ Easy rollback
✅ Full testing
❌ Double resources

### Canary Deployment
✅ Low risk
✅ Gradual validation
❌ Complex setup

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Manual deployments
- ❌ Friday deployments
- ❌ No rollback plan
- ❌ Deploying without testing
- ❌ No health checks
- ❌ No monitoring after deploy

## Recommended Platforms
- **Vercel** - Next.js, React (automatic)
- **Railway** - Full-stack, databases
- **Render** - Simple, affordable
- **Fly.io** - Edge deployment
- **DigitalOcean** - More control
