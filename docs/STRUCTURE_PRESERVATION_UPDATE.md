# Structure Preservation Update

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: 100% Source Image Structure Preservation
**Workflow**: Sketch-to-Render

## Problem Statement

User feedback: *"die hauptstruktur muss immer ausgansgsbild sein also dass nochmal im backend halt fixxen ausgangsbild soll 100% struktur behalten"*

The generated renders were not consistently preserving the exact structure, layout, proportions, and composition of the source sketch/floor plan images. This is critical for architectural visualization where spatial accuracy is paramount.

## Solution Implemented

Modified all GPT-4o prompt enhancement system prompts to explicitly enforce 100% structure preservation from source images.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `lib/api/workflows/sketchToRender/gptEnhancer.ts`

**Function**: `enhanceSketchToRenderPrompt()`
**Lines Modified**: 213-243, 271-273

**Changes**:
- Added "CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" section to system prompt
- Explicitly states: "The output MUST PRESERVE 100% OF THE SOURCE IMAGE STRUCTURE"
- Lists specific preservation requirements:
  - EXACT SAME layout, proportions, dimensions, and architectural elements
  - SAME camera angle, perspective, and viewpoint
  - DO NOT change room sizes, wall positions, window placements, or spatial relationships
  - DO NOT alter composition, framing, or overall structure
  - ONLY enhance with materials, lighting, textures, and photorealistic details
  - "The source sketch structure is SACRED - preserve it completely"

- Added user message instruction:
  - "CRITICAL STRUCTURE PRESERVATION: The source sketch's EXACT structure, layout, proportions, camera angle, and composition MUST be preserved 100%"
  - Updated prompt to include "preserve exact source structure" phrase

#### 2. `lib/api/workflows/sketchToRender/promptGenerator.ts`

**Function**: `generateSketchToRenderPrompt()` (T-Button)
**Lines Modified**: 36-67, 116-118

**Changes**:
- Added "CRITICAL RULES - STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" section to system prompt
- Explicitly states: "PRESERVE 100% OF THE SOURCE IMAGE STRUCTURE - this is MANDATORY"
- Lists specific preservation requirements identical to gptEnhancer.ts
- Emphasizes: "The source sketch structure is SACRED - preserve it completely"

- Added user message instruction:
  - "CRITICAL STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" with explicit requirements
  - Updated prompt to include "preserve exact source structure" phrase

#### 3. `lib/api/workflows/sketchToRender/editEnhancer.ts`

**Function**: `enhanceEditPrompt()`
**Lines Modified**: 46-71, 80-92

**Changes**:
- Added "CRITICAL STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" section to system prompt
- Explicitly states: "PRESERVE 100% OF THE IMAGE STRUCTURE - this is MANDATORY"
- Specifies that ONLY the specific elements requested by user should be modified
- "The existing structure is SACRED - preserve it completely"

- Added user message instruction:
  - "CRITICAL STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" section
  - Specifies to preserve 100% of structure, layout, proportions, camera angle, and composition
  - Updated prompt to include "preserve exact structure" phrase

## Technical Implementation

### System Prompt Strategy

All three files now include explicit structure preservation instructions in their GPT-4o system prompts:

1. **Preservation Requirements**: Detailed list of what must stay the same
2. **Modification Scope**: Clear definition of what can be enhanced (materials, lighting, textures)
3. **Sacred Structure**: Emphasizes that source structure is "SACRED" and must be preserved completely

### User Message Strategy

All three files include runtime instructions in the user messages sent to GPT-4o:

1. **Explicit Instruction**: "CRITICAL STRUCTURE PRESERVATION" section in every request
2. **Phrase Inclusion**: Ensures generated prompts include "preserve exact structure" phrase
3. **Reinforcement**: Multiple layers of instruction to ensure compliance

## Expected Behavior

### Before Update
- Generated renders might alter room proportions
- Camera angles could shift
- Wall positions or window placements might change
- Overall composition could be modified

### After Update
- Generated renders MUST preserve exact layout from source sketch
- Camera angle and perspective stay identical
- Room sizes, wall positions, window placements remain unchanged
- Overall composition and framing preserved completely
- ONLY materials, lighting, textures, and photorealistic details are added

## Testing

To verify structure preservation:

1. Upload a sketch/floor plan with clear architectural elements
2. Generate a render using the main "Generate" button
3. Verify that:
   - Room proportions match source exactly
   - Wall positions are identical
   - Window/door placements unchanged
   - Camera angle/perspective preserved
   - Only materials and lighting are enhanced

4. Test editing:
   - Generate a render
   - Use "Bearbeiten" to modify specific elements (e.g., "change sofa color to blue")
   - Verify that ONLY the requested element changes
   - All other structure remains identical

## Impact

### Workflows Affected
- ✅ Main Generation (Generate button)
- ✅ T-Button Prompt Generation
- ✅ Edit/Refine Function (Bearbeiten)

### User Benefits
- Accurate architectural visualizations
- Reliable sketch-to-render transformations
- Predictable edit behavior
- Professional-quality structure fidelity

## Related Issues

- Upscaling polling issue (separate from this fix)
- Rate limiting on edits (already fixed with separate limiter)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Structure preservation implemented
2. ⏳ Debug upscaling polling failure
3. ⏳ User testing and feedback collection

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Build Status**: ✅ Compiling (dev server running)
**Ready for Testing**: YES
